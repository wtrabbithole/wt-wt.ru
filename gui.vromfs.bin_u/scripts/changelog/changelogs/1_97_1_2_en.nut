    "For most 'air-to-air' missiles the launch range has been changed to real values at low altitudes - reduced by about 25-30%. The reduction at mid and high altitudes is insignificant."
    "IR seekers of “air-to-air” missiles now can handle multiple targets inside the seeker FoV in a proper way: missiles no longer turn away from targets."
    "'Igla', 'Stinger' and 'Mistral' missiles - corrected flight performance and seeker parameters: engine thrust has been increased, lateral acceleration has been decreased."
    "'Firestreak' missile has been tuned according to sources: lateral acceleration and seeker gimbal angles have been increased, pure pursuit guidance method is used instead of proportional navigation."
    "The flight performance of the R-60M missile has been configured according to sources: now it matches the flight performance of R-60 missile."
    "Cloud cover now reduces the target lock-on range for IR and laser homing sensors, as well as the optical equipment of helicopters and missile-equipped AA vehicles."
    "Speed and flight time of all air-launched ATGM’s has been configured according to reference. Maximal launch range now depends on launcher and target altitude. The Maximum launch distance of “Vikhr” at ground level has been decreased from 10 km to 8.6 km. For other ATGM’s, the change in maximum launch distance is insufficient."
    "F-4M FGR-2 - radar warning receiver and “air-to-air” missiles launch zone computer has been added to radar. Ballistic computer for bombs, rockets and cannons has been added."
    "F-4C - the modular set has received RWR (radar warning system)."
    "MiG-21F-13, MiG-21MF and MiG-21SMT - “air-to-air” missiles launch zone computer has been added to radar rangefinder and radar, respectively."
    "MiG-21MF and MiG-21SMT - Ballistic computer for rockets and cannons has been added."
    "F-4C - “air-to-air” missiles launch zone computer has been added to radar."
    "T-2 - “air-to-air” missiles launch zone computer has been added to radar. Ballistic computer for bombs, rockets and cannons has been added."
    "AH-1F and AH-1Z received autosight for rockets.  The AH-1Z now features autosight for cannons and automatic aiming in cannon turret on a chosen target."
    "The Tiger UHT has received an automatic sight for rockets and cannons"
    "Mi-28N received SPO-150 “Pastel” instead of SPO-15 'Bereza' radar warning receiver. The amount of ammunition for the 2A42 cannon has been adjusted to 250 shots."
    "Mi-24, Mi-35M, Mi-28N and Ka-50 helicopters received automatic sight for rockets and cannons. The Mi-28N and Ka-50 helicopters received automatic aiming of cannon turrets on a chosen target."
    "AH-1S helicopter received automatic sight for rockets."
    "A-129A received an automatic sight for rockets and cannons, as well as automatic aiming of turret at a chosen target."
    "Tiger HAP and Tiger HAD received an automatic sight for rockets and cannons, as well as automatic aiming of turret at a chosen target."
    "Aircraft cannons GSh-30, NR-30, N-37 — Recoil when firing has been decreased."
    "The type of shell for the 30mm cannon of the Tiger HAP and HAD has been changed from HEF-I to SAPHEI. The ballistic range has been increased. Kinetic piercing has been added. Now the shell retains its effectiveness when shooting at targets at a distance of up to 3 km."
    "The incorrect displayed localization for the RP-3 missiles for some aircraft has been fixed."
    "Pyorremyrsky - The belt setup and ammunition for the 12.7 mm LKk/42 machine gun have been changed."
    "J20 - Weaponry composition for the Akan m/40 machine guns has been changed."
    "J11 - Weaponry composition for the Akan m/40 machine guns has been changed."

    "All helicopters - unrecoverable roll when maximum allowed speed is exceeded in arcade mode has been removed."
    "LaGG-3 -11/23/34/35/66 series - a bug has been fixed with an incorrect display of flight time depending on the amount of fuel selected."
    "Bombs from 100 to 3,000 pounds (USA, Britain) - bugs have been fixed leading to incorrect parasitic drag."
    "FFAR, Mighty Mouse - drag of suspended blocks has been corrected."
    "Halifax B Mk.III - name and model of engines in the 'X-ray' mode in the hangar have been fixed."
    "A21A-3 - bug has been fixed with incorrect fuel tank filling."
