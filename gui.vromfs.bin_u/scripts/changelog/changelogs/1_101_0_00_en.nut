  "A laser radar system has been added for vehicles equipped with a detection warning system."
  "In combined ground battles in SB game mode, new mechanics have been introduced where, after respawn, allies will be marked for the player on the mini-map for 7 seconds. This has been done to understand better the positions of the players and for better interaction between players."
  "The distance for the identification of naval vessels in battles has been increased (switching of the name of the ship on an enemy marker)."

  "The sounds of cannons and machine guns of land and sea vehicles have been corrected towards greater clarity. The low-frequency component of the shot has also been emphasized."
  "New sound events for the M61 rotary gun (SPAAG M163) have been created."
  "Principle of reverb response for all sounds has been changed in order to make the sound more natural. Previously, algorithmic reverberation was used (real-time calculation of the reflection of sound from a certain virtual volume, the parameters of which are set by a mathematical function), now convolution reverberation is used (that is, the application of the convolution operation to the original sound in the game, and the reference sound recorded in real conditions). For sounds inside the cockpit of an aircraft or a tank, real reflections (impulse response of a real volume, like street, room, cockpit, etc.) are used, recorded in the interiors of actual military vehicles. For the sounds of the environment, real reflections were used, recorded in the field, and in areas with medium and dense buildings. Also, when approaching the ground on an aircraft with a third person view, you can feel the reflections of sounds from the land surface."
  "Sounds of flying bullets and shells have been changed. Now they click or clap as they fly past the listener."
  "A bug has been fixed due to which the shell/bullet flypast sound was played when hitting the player's vehicle. Now the sound of flight only sounds when it passes by."
  "Now, when a tank turret is ripped off, it falls to the ground with a characteristic sound."
