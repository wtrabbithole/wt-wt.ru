"AI vehicle counters have been disabled. In fact, previously they duplicated the victory point lines, but might not depict the actual required number of vehicles for victory, for example when bombing zones are destroyed. Now the only indicator is the victory points scale."
"All AI ground vehicles now affect the victory point scale, the number of AI vehicles has been increased. Previously, destruction of light vehicles didn’t affect victory points. Players are now free to destroy any targets of their choice, both light (artillery, trucks, AA guns) and heavy (tanks and bunkers)."
"The automatic feature in the destruction of AI vehicles has been disabled. New AI vehicles will appear - ground attackers, which spawn for every team and destroy the AI ground vehicles."
"AI ground vehicles distribution has been improved. Vehicles now appear all along the 10 km frontline, or split into 3-4 zones along the frontline. Previously, AI vehicles were grouped in a single 2-4 km zone, or the distance between groups of vehicles was too long."
