Now for low and medium rank battles, airfields are located 7000 metres away from the centre of the location and for high rank battles the distance has been increased to 12,000 metres (previously airfields were mainly located at distances of 6000-9000 metres)."

    "For the listed missions (above) the vehicle counters have been disabled. They basically duplicated the score displayed at the top of the screen but it occasionally didn't reflect the actual number of vehicles required for victory when for example the bombers had destroyed several bomb zones whilst the number of victory points decreased."
    "For the listed missions (above) when an opponent's aircraft has been destroyed the victory points for the team were deducted (shooting down aircraft didn't affect the points previously). The same mechanism will be used in the 'Airfield Domination' missions and has proved itself useful."
